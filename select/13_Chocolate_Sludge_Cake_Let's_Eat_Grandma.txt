I've got a foot in my mouth
I've got a tongue on my feet
I've got beady eyes to see, antennae
And I sigh all the time
Yeah

It's time to bake a cake
I'm gonna make a carrot cake
No, I'm gonna make an apple cake
No, I'm gonna make a coffee cake (eugh!)
No, I'm gonna make a chocolate cake, a chocolate cake
A chocolate cake, a chocolate cake

Sometimes when I'm sad
I go inside (I go inside)
I go inside (Night for tonight)
And sometimes when I'm tired
I go inside (I go inside, I go inside)
I live inside my mist at night

When the milk's expired
Then I was right, select a type, select a bite, I take a bite
And someone on the outside
Turns off the lights
I'm in the dark, so terrified, I'm petrified
