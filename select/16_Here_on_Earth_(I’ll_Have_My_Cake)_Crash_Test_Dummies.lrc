[00:08.08] Some folks say that life is just a veil of tears
[00:16.86] Not me man I can't pack enough into these years
[00:22.02] I don't care if it's spring summer winter or fall
[00:27.11] Make no fuss about the seasons, 'cause I like 'em all
[00:53.61] 
[00:32.22] Here on earth I'll have my cake
[00:36.19] Gonna eat it too, make no mistake
[00:38.47] 'Cause if it's a question of to be or not to be
[00:42.55] I'll put on my boots and go see what I can see
[01:05.55] 
[00:48.84] My grandpa, well a good Christian life he led
[01:05.71] Worked like a dog just to put a roof over his head
[01:10.75] He said that when he died he'd get his reward
[01:15.80] 'Cause heaven's a place where you don't pay room & board
[01:43.80] 
[01:21.28] Here on earth I'll have my cake
[01:25.06] Gonna eat it too, make no mistake
[01:27.58] 'Cause if it's a question of to be or not to be
[01:31.44] I'll put on my boots and go see what I can see
[01:54.44] 
[01:39.38] When I die, I hope I don't die too slow
[02:10.92] But slow or quick, I hope heaven is the place I go
[02:16.36] Old St. Pete's gonna serve me my pie in the sky
[02:21.36] And I'll say "Pete, a side of ice cream, if you don't mind."
[02:51.36] 
[02:26.61] Here on earth I'll have my cake
[02:30.36] Gonna eat it too, make no mistake
[02:33.15] 'Cause if it's a question of to be or not to be
[02:37.14] I'll put on my boots and go see what I can see
